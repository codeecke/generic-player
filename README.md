## What is ZuluPlayer?

ZuluPlayer is an intelligent javascript-library for easy implementation of videos from different providers to your project.

It’s no longer important where your videos are hosted. With ZuluPlayer you’ve got one single api to control videos from youtube, vimeo, dailymotion, jw-player and selfhosted html-videos.

ZuluPlayer is [open-source](https://github.com/zuluplayer/player), has a [detailed documentation](http://www.zuluplayer.com/docs/) and can easily customized by [plugins](http://www.zuluplayer.com/#plugins) and player-implementations.



## How to install
```bash
npm install @zuluplayer/player
